// Which slots each nldd-* component actually defines, and which ones a source
// tree assigns to. Shared by check-nldd-slots.mjs and its test.
//
// The reason this needs checking at all: a `slot="..."` that a component does
// not define is not an error anywhere. The element stays in the light DOM,
// never gets assigned to a shadow-DOM slot, and lays out as 0x0 — present in
// the DOM, invisible on screen, silent in the console. Two of those sat in the
// demo unnoticed: the persona tags on the portal and the "Start de
// presentatie" button, both on `slot="actions"` of `nldd-title`, which only
// has `overline`, `subtitle` and `end`.
